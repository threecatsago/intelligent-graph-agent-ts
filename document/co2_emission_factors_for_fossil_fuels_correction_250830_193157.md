CO₂ Emission Factors for Fossil Fuels

CO \(_2\)  Emission Factors for Fossil Fuels

byKristina JuhrichEmissions Situation (Section I 2.6)German Environment Agency (UBA) June 2016

Short description

Germany is obligated to report its national emissions of greenhouse gases, annually, to the European Union and the United Nations. Over  \(80\%\)  of the greenhouse- gas emissions reported by Germany occur via combustion of fossil fuels. The great majority of the emissions consist of carbon dioxide. To calculate carbon dioxide emissions, one needs both the relevant activity data and suitable emission factors, with the latter depending on the applicable fuel quality and input quantities. In light of these elements' importance for emission factors, the German inventory uses country- specific emission factors rather than international, average factors. To determine such factors, one requires a detailed knowledge of the fuel compositions involved, especially with regard to carbon content and net calorific values.

The present publication provides an overview of the quality characteristics of the most important fuels used in Germany and of the  \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  emission factors calculated on the basis of those characteristics. Since annual greenhouse- gas emissions have to be calculated back to 1990, the study also considers fuels that are no longer used today. To that end, archival data are used. Gaps in the data are closed with the help of methods for recalculation back through the base year.

## 1 Introduction

Combustion- related  \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  emissions are calculated by multiplying the relevant fuel data, as obtained from statistics, by the applicable emission factors. The emission factors for this purpose depend primarily on the carbon content and net calorific value of the fuels involved. Over  \(80\%\)  of all German greenhouse- gas emissions are calculated in this manner. For this reason, the quality of the factors is of central importance.

The  \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  emission factors for reporting on greenhouse gases (cf. the tables in Chapter 7) are determined primarily on the basis of data, on measured fuel parameters, that are reported and anonymised in the context of emissions trading. Annual data are available on net calorific values, emission factors, fuel quantities and data quality. The data undergo thorough quality checks. For example, only factors from tier levels 3 or 4 enter into calculations. In every case, tier level 3 and 4 values are analysis values that are representative for the entire year. The two tier levels differ solely in terms of the applicable uncertainties. In the context of emissions trading, some substance streams are not uniquely named, and this leads to erroneous material allocations in connection with solid fuels. In the case of coal, such misallocations can be unambiguously identified via the net calorific value and then subsequently reallocated. Lignite and hard coal can be clearly and unambiguously differentiated via their net calorific values. Annually weighted averages are calculated from the quality- checked data. To check whether the so- determined factors are truly representative, the underlying fuel quantities are compared with the corresponding figures from the Energy Balance. In addition, care is taken to ensure the greatest possible consistency between net calorific values and emission factors. Ultimately, such work also supports quality assurance of emissions trading data.

Data from sources in addition to emissions trading were used as well. Furthermore, we evaluated relevant archive data, and we carried out measurements of our own. The recalculations back through the year 1990 were carried out with a range of widely differing procedures. In each case, the most suitable procedure for the specific situation was selected. This approach was designed to assure the consistency of the time series - and to provide the most realistic solutions possible. Finding well- documented archive data for the year 1990 proved to be a challenge, since documents for that year were available only in paper form, and housed at a range of different institutions. In addition, it was found that data were seldom kept for longer than 20 years. What is more, the qualities of the fuels used in the former GDR tended to differ - considerably, in some cases - from the qualities of the fuels used in the old German Lander. Since some of the terminology used in this connection in the former GDR was not used at all in statistics of the former Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), the relevant fuels had to be assigned to fuel groups used in the latter country. For example, in the Energy Balance, "lignite tar" was placed in the meta- lignite (Hartbraunkohle) category. In the final analysis, the task of positively identifying such exotic fuels proved possible only with the help of experts on this subject. Due to the long time period involved, however, some of the pertinent experts had already retired. The scope of the task was limited by carrying out highly detailed considerations solely for the base year 1990. For the years 1990 - 1994, all relevant statistics are available, broken down by old and new German Lander. For interim years, a number of assumptions had to be made, since even less information was available for those years than was available for 1990. In addition, a great many installations were decommissioned in the new German Lander in the early 1990s. In some years, such closures led to sudden fuel changes.

## 2 Oxidation factors

2 Oxidation factorsThe 1996 IPCC Guidelines, which were the valid source for the calculation methods to be used for reporting through 2014, listed default values for oxidation factors. Those oxidation factors were calculated from the carbon content remaining in ash. The currently valid 2006 IPCC Guidelines work from a basis of complete fuel oxidation and no longer include that calculation step. In each case, they apply an

oxidation factor of 1. The German Greenhouse- Gas- Emissions- Trading Act (Treibhausgas- Emission- shandelsgesetz) also specifies an oxidation factor of 1. For this reason, emissions trading data do not include data on carbon content remaining in ash. Neither do any other sources provide reliable and representative data for this area. For this reason, an oxidation factor of 1 is assumed. In the German greenhouse- gas inventory, pertinent calculations have always been based on assumed complete oxidation, due to the uncertainties in the data.

## 3 Hard coal

### 3.1 Grades of hard coal

The quantities of hard coal used in Germany have been decreasing since 1990. At the same time, hard coal's share of Germany's primary energy consumption has hardly changed at all. In 2014, it amounted to about  \(13\%\) . On the other hand, the sources for Germany's hard- coal supply have changed considerably. Throughout the course of the time series, these changes have led to changes in average net calorific values and carbon content. The following figures provide an overview of the sources of Germany's hard- coal supply in 1990 and in 2014.

Whereas in 1990, the great majority of the hard coal used in Germany was mined within Germany itself, the country now imports most of its hard coal. And Germany's hard- coal mining sector will shut down completely in 2018. From that point on, Germany will use only imported hard coal.

The fraction of coal that Germany imports from South Africa and Poland has remained about the same since 1990. On the other hand, imports from Australia, the U.S., Colombia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - primarily from Russia - have increased considerably. Imports from Canada and from other EU countries have also increased - although not to the same degree.

### 3.2 Net calorific values and carbon content

Coal- quality characteristics differ from mining region to mining region. In some cases, different open- pit mines within the same region will yield different grades of coal. At the same time, quality differences tend to be not as pronounced in hard coal as they are in lignite. The following figures show net calorific value / carbon ratios for various grades of hard coal. In each case, the carbon content figures and net calorific values refer to the original substance.

With the help of the figure, specific profiles can be derived for the different grades of hard coal produced in the countries shown. South African and Indonesian hard coals have very similar properties, whereas German hard coal has considerably different properties.

On average, German hard coal has higher net calorific values and carbon content levels. German hard coal is mined at depths greater than  \(1000\mathrm{m}\) , and under difficult geological conditions. While the coal so extracted is thus of high quality, it cannot be extracted at competitive prices. Originally, German hard coal was mined at sites near the city of Ilbenbüren, along the Saar and Ruhr rivers and near the city of Aachen. The last remaining mines along the Ruhr River and near Ilbenbüren will be closed at the end of 2018.

Figure 5: Net calorific values & carbon content levels of hard coal from Russia, the U.S., Venezuela and Australia

Most varieties of hard coal have a carbon content (with respect to the original substance) between 60 and  \(75\%\) . The average content, which can vary from year to year, ranges between 65 and  \(66\%\) . Hard coal within the lower range, up to a carbon content of about  \(56\%\) , and a net calorific value of no more than  \(22 \mathrm{MJ / kg}\) , is referred to as low- grade coal. Hard coal within the upper range is of coking- coal quality. The highest carbon content, reaching values over  \(30\%\) , is found in anthracite coal.

Hard coal is commonly classified in terms of its fractions of volatile components. Coal classifications include flame coal (Flammkohle), gas flame coal (Gasflammkohle), gas coal (gaskohle), fat coal (Fettkohle), forge coal (Esskohle), non- baking coal (Magerkohle) and anthracite (Anthrazit). Since hydrogen is among the volatile components in coal, this classification scheme cannot be directly applied to the evaluation carried out in the present study. For purposes of emission calculation, the carbon content and the lower heating value (net calorific value) are of central importance.

In addition to the substance streams that, on the basis of their designation, can be assigned to specific areas of origin, significant quantities of mixed coal and of coal of uncertain origin have to be considered. Data relative to those quantities were also evaluated. The "other hard coal" types of coal also exhibit a fixed net calorific value / carbon ratio. The hard coal that cannot be assigned to specific areas of origin basically falls onto the same ratio line as that formed by hard coal from known areas of origin. This relationship is particularly pronounced in hard coal, because sulphur and hydrogen content levels do not vary as much in hard coal as they do in other fuels. A fuel's sulphur and hydrogen content influences its net calorific value. Since these elements – logically enough – do not include any carbon, these parameters affect the slopes of the lines.

### 3.3 Calculation of  \(CO_2\)  emission factors for hard coal

\(CO_2\)  emission factors and net calorific values were determined for all relevant coal fractions of known origin (Germany, South Africa, Australia, Indonesia, Colombia, Norway, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, U.S. and Venezuela). In addition, weighted averages were calculated for the "other hard coal" fractions that cannot be assigned to specific areas of origin. Two different methods for calculating hard- coal emission factors for previous years of the time series were reviewed. In one method, a weighted average for each year was calculated using data for the individual areas of origin, along with import- stream data given in hard- coal statistics. In the other method, a weighted average was formed from all of the verified emission factors reported in emissions trading. Since the pertinent values differ only very slightly in most years (with differences ranging between 0.02 and  \(0.35\%\) ), as of 2006 weighted emission factors for all hard coal reported in emissions trading (except that used in the iron & steel sector) can be used - regardless of the areas of origin involved. The recalculations back through 1990 are carried out by combining the origin- specific emission factors, as determined from emissions trading data, with the relevant import streams. This produces a consistent time series. Over the years, the weighted emission factor for hard coal increases slightly, from 93.1 t  \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\)  in 1990 to 94.3 t  \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\)  in 2011. As of that year, the factor then decreases slightly. All in all, the German values, on average, are slightly below the default value given by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, 94.6 t  \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\) .

Review of the individual values used in emissions trading shows that changes in the applicable regulations have considerably enhanced the quality of net calorific values and emission factors, especially those used as of 2008. In addition, the quantity of hard coal that can be clearly assigned to specific areas of origin has decreased considerably. For this reason, the most sensible approach is to form weighted averages that cover all hard coal, regardless of area of origin. This is the only way to ensure that the resulting emission factors are truly representative.

Inter- sectoral emission factors are calculated for hard coal. This ensures that the relevant total emissions are determined as precisely as possible. Apart from the fact that the calculations needed to produce sector- specific emission factors would be unreasonably laborious, the emissions trading sector and official statistics (which provide the basis for the national greenhouse- gas inventory) do not always agree in their emissions allocations to specific industrial sectors, and thus sector- specific calculation of emission factors, as a general basis, would necessarily lead to errors. In the present case, such an approach would make it impossible to assure the correctness of the resulting total- emissions data.

### 3.4 Coking coal, hard coal and hard-coal products of the steel industry

An exception is made for the iron and steel industry; sector- specific emission factors have been calculated for it. The coking coal data used by the iron and steel industry are not calculated on an inter- sectoral basis, since that coal can be unambiguously identified. Furthermore, few reliable net- calorific- value data are available. Although a formula for calculating net calorific values could be derived using the above figures, such a derivation would be too cumbersome in the present case. The relevant emissions can be calculated directly using the carbon- content data available from emissions trading and statistics on steel production, which are already available in natural units. To prevent double- counting, the pertinent coal is not included in calculation of emission factors for hard coal overall. For the iron & steel sector, the inventory gives only mass- related emission factors.

From the same data set, it was possible to calculate emission factors for hard- coal coke, hard- coal tar and benzene, all of which the Energy Balance combines under "Other hard- coal products."

For all other sectors in which hard- coal coke is used, a net- calorific- value- related  \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  emission factor of 108.1 t  \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\)  was calculated. That value is somewhat higher than the IPCC default value of 107 t  \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\) . Since hard- coal coke is a compound product of defined composition, with only slight quality fluctuations, an average is used for pertinent calculations. The annual substance- value fluctuations lie

within the uncertainties range. With this in mind, an average covering a 9- year period was formed. The resulting value is reviewed on an annual basis. If any significant changes occur, the factor will be suitably adjusted.

### 3.5 Hard coal and hard-coal briquettes in small combustion plants

Since emissions trading data do not include hard- coal briquettes used in small combustion plants, Technische Universität Dresden, Faculty of Mechanical Science and Engineering, carried out analyses of its own for this area, in the framework of the project "Adjustment of methods used in German GHG- emissions inventories, to bring them into line with the revised 'UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Parties included in Annex I to the convention'" ("Methodische Anpassung der deutschen THG- Emissionsinventare an die überarbeiteten 'UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Parties included in Annex I to the convention."") (Öko- Institut 2014), and at the Institute of Power Engineering (Institut für Energietechnik). The resulting values were carried back through the year 1990, since no representative values were available for the base year. In all likelihood, most of the hard- coal briquettes used at that time were German hard- coal briquettes. Today, only imported briquettes are used. Since the last German hard- coal- briquette factory was closed in 2007, it was not possible to analyze this fuel (German hard coal briquettes). On the other hand, hard- coal briquettes are a defined product whose carbon content and net calorific values vary only slightly. Consequently, the error that results from the relevant assumption is also very small.

The anthracite coal burned in households and in other small combustion plants was also studied. For anthracite, data from emissions trading are available. The  \(\mathrm{CO_2}\)  emission factors calculated from the emissions trading data are higher than those determined via the analyses. A mean value of  \(97.6\mathrm{t}\) \(\mathrm{CO_2 / TJ}\)  was calculated from the combination of emission trading data and analysis results. That value is closer to the default value of  \(98.3\mathrm{t}\mathrm{CO}_2 / \mathrm{TJ}\)  given in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

The following table presents an overview of the results from the analyses.

## 4 Lignite

### 4.1 Raw lignite

4.1 Raw ligniteDeutschland is the world's largest lignite producer. The great majority of the raw lignite mined in the country is used directly, in power stations, while a small fraction of the lignite is used to make transformation products. The composition of raw lignite varies considerably more widely than does that of hard coal. Sulphur content is an important parameter. That parameter can differ greatly from mining district to mining district. Since sulphur content is of relevance to the net calorific value, it influences the net calorific value / carbon ratio. As a result, the data have to be evaluated on a mining- district- specific basis. When enough data are used, the mining- district- specific evaluation for lignite, like the evaluation for hard coal, shows a clear correlation between net calorific value and carbon content, as the following figures show.

The separate graphs for the different German lignite- mining districts can be clearly interpreted. The integrated graph, which summarizes the data for the most important German lignite- mining districts, highlights the differences between the individual profiles. The raw lignite from the two eastern German mining districts has a higher sulphur content, on average, than does coal from the Rhineland district. The highest sulphur content is seen in lignite from the central German (Mitteldeutschland) district. It amounts to  \(1.3 - 2.1\%\)  (DEBRIV 2014). As a result, the net calorific values for that lignite are higher, on average, than those for lignite from the other two mining districts. Lignite from the Helmstedt mining district has an even higher sulphur content, ranging from 1.5 to  \(3.5\%\)  (DEBRIV 2014). The quantities of coal used from that district are insignificant in comparison to the coal quantities sourced from the other districts, however. What is more, use of the open- pit mine and the remaining coal deposits in the Helmstedt mining district is expected to continue only until 2017.

### 4.2 Determination of emission factors back through 1990

For the period as of 2005, annual, mining- district- specific emission factors can be calculated from emissions trading data. Since lignite quality levels have changed since 1990, the currently used emission factors cannot simply be carried backward. In particular, a number of coal pits were closed in the new German Länder in the early 1990s, and this influenced the mining- district- specific average. The pertinent changes are reflected in the development of net calorific values, which are available on a mining- district- specific basis for the period as of 1990. The data are provided to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) by the DEBRIV Federal German association of lignite- producing companies and their affiliated organisations.

Thanks to the good correlation between net calorific values and carbon fractions, a suitable formula can be derived for nearly every mining district. With the help of the so- produced formulae, and the net
